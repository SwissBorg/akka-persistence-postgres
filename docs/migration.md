# Migrations

## Migration from akka-persistence-jdbc 4.0.0
It is possible to migrate existing journals from Akka Persistence JDBC 4.0.0. 
Since we decided to extract metadata from the serialized payload and store it in a separate column it is not possible to migrate exiting journal and snapshot store using plain SQL scripts.

### How migration works
Each journal event and snapshot has to be read, deserialized, metadata and tags must be extracted and then everything stored in the new table.

We provide you with an optional artifact, `akka-persistence-postgres-migration` that brings to your project the necessary classes to automate the above process.

*Important*: Our util classes neither drop nor update any old data. Original tables will be still there but renamed with an `old_` prefix. It's up to you when to drop them.

### How to use plugin provided migrations
#### Add akka-persistence-migration to your project
Add the following to your `build.sbt` 
```
libraryDependencies += "com.swissborg" %% "akka-persistence-postgres-migration" % "0.5.0"
``` 
For a maven project add: 
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.swisborg</groupId>
    <artifactId>akka-persistence-postgres-migration_2.13</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0</version>
</dependency>
``` 
to your `pom.xml`.

#### Create and run migrations:
```scala
import akka.persistence.postgres.migration.journal.Jdbc4JournalMigration
import akka.persistence.postgres.migration.snapshot.Jdbc4SnapshotStoreMigration

for {
_ <- new Jdbc4JournalMigration(config).run()
_ <- new Jdbc4SnapshotStoreMigration(config).run()
} yield ()
```
*Very important note*: The migration has to be finished before your application starts any persistent actors!

It's your choice whether you want to trigger migration manually or (recommended) leverage a database version control system of your choice (e.g. Flyway).

### Examples
An example Flyway-based migration can be found in the demo app: https://github.com/mkubala/demo-akka-persistence-postgres/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/github/mkubala/FlywayMigrationExample.scala

## Migration from akka-persistence-postgres 0.4.0 to 0.5.0
New indices need to be created on each partition, to avoid locking production databases for too long, it should be done in 2 steps:
1. manually create indices CONCURRENTLY,
2. deploy new release with migration scripts.

### Manually create indices CONCURRENTLY
Execute DDL statements produced by the [sample migration script](https://github.com/SwissBorg/akka-persistence-postgres/blob/master/scripts/migration-0.5.0/partitioned/1-add-indices-manually.sql), adapt top level variables to match your journal configuration before executing.

### Deploy new release with migration scripts
See [sample flyway migration script](https://github.com/SwissBorg/akka-persistence-postgres/blob/master/scripts/migration-0.5.0/partitioned/2-add-indices-flyway.sql) and adapt top level variables to match your journal configuration.

## Migration from akka-persistence-postgres 0.5.0 to 0.6.0

Version 0.6.0 aims to improve the performance of the query that has the most DB I/O when using this plugin: 
```sql
select max("sequence_number") from "journal" where "persistence_id" = ?
```

We introduced a new `journal_metadata` table that will be holding key data per persistence id, that will be used to speed up the above query and others (like the one used to replay events). To do this, we are trading off a bit of performance at event write time and the query read time. This impact is caused by the usage of a DB trigger that is executed everytime an insert on the journal happens.
So, for now this table is holding the following information per persistence id:
- max sequence number among all the associated events; 
- min and max ordering interval where the events are located within the journal; 

We believe the trade-off is worth it since the impact on write performance is much lower that the gain when read time, observed on these queries that take the most of the DB I/O.

Below is the list of sample flyway migration scripts you can use to add this new table and associated triggers.
⚠️ The last one of them is a simplistic data migration to populate the new table. However, if your data size is big consider using a more lazy ad-hoc alternative that does batch reads from the journal and inserts the missing data. The trigger you will be adding is idempotent, so it is safe to re-process some events when the ad-hoc job is catching up to present date events.    

1. [create journal_metadata table](https://github.com/SwissBorg/akka-persistence-postgres/blob/master/scripts/migration-0.6.0/1-create-journal-metadata-table.sql)
2. [create function to update journal_metadata](https://github.com/SwissBorg/akka-persistence-postgres/blob/master/scripts/migration-0.6.0/2-create-function-update-journal-metadata.sql)
3. [create trigger to update journal_metadata](https://github.com/SwissBorg/akka-persistence-postgres/blob/master/scripts/migration-0.6.0/3-create-trigger-update-journal-metadata.sql)
4. [populate journal_metadata with past data](https://github.com/SwissBorg/akka-persistence-postgres/blob/master/scripts/migration-0.6.0/4-populate-journal-metadata.sql)

⚠️ Ensure to adapt the top level variables of the scripts to appropriate values that match your journal configuration/setup.

Keep in mind that the usage of the new table by the queries is not enabled by default, so the previous (v0.5.0) behaviour is kept. 
In order to make use of it you need to specify it through the configuration of your journal:

```hocon
{
  postgres-journal {
    ...

    use-journal-metadata = true # Default is false
  }
  
  # Same applies to the read journal
  postgres-read-journal {
    ...

    use-journal-metadata = true # Default is false
  }
}
```

Another important change that was introduced was that there is now a `FlatReadJournalDao` and a `PartitionedReadJournalDao`. 
The first is the direct replacement of the previous `ByteArrayReadJournalDao` and it is the one set by default. 
However, with the addition of the `journal_metadata`, if you are using the partitioned journal please change it to `PartitionedReadJournalDao`, 
as some of the queries in use will benefit from it.

```hocon
{
  postgres-read-journal {
    ...
      
    dao = "akka.persistence.postgres.query.dao.PartitionedReadJournalDao"
    use-journal-metadata = true # Default is false
  }
}
```

⚠️ Also, since a new table is being added it might be required for you to adapt your `postgres-journal.tables` configuration.
